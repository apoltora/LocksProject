Using micro-benchesÂ to compare and contrast the consequences of different locks, we will be rigorously testing a set of locks (namely queue, ticket, etc.) to see their overhead, contention, fairness, and other, and measuring how each compares. The micro-benches will be very simple so that the focus remains on the locks.
