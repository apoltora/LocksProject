Description:

    Using micro-benchmarksÂ to compare and analyze the abortable locks(MCS-Time_published and CLH-try) with other locks like CLH and TAS(test and set).


    The microbenchmarks folder contains the following folders:
        mb1, mb2, mb3, mb4: codes for various microbenchmarks from 1 to 4 respectively
        test1, test5: test1 and test5 contains the codes used for test 1 and test 5 respectively
        pre_checkpoint: this folder contains all the files coded before checkpoint. But these codes WERE NOT used for our final analysis and final report.
